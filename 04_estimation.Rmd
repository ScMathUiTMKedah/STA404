**Estimation** refers to the process by which one makes inferences about a population, based on information obtained from a sample. In this situation, a sample is selected from a population and data gathered from the sample will be used to estimate the parameter of a population. The relationship between estimation, estimate and estimator is that `estimation` is the process of finding an `estimate` of a parameter using an `estimator`. There are two types of estimation: *point estimate* and *interval estimate*.\

A **point estimate** in statistics is a single value that serves as a best guess of an unknown parameter of a population, such as the mean or the standard deviation. It is calculated from sample data using a point estimator, which is a function that maps the data to the point estimate. The accuracy of a point estimate is not known precisely, but it can be improved by increasing the sample size. Point estimates are often used in other statistical calculations, such as confidence intervals.\

**Interval estimation** in statistics is the use of sample data to estimate an interval of possible values of a parameter of interest. This is in contrast to point estimation, which gives a single value. Intervals are commonly chosen such that the parameter falls within with a 95 or 99 percent probability, called the confidence coefficient.\

# Interval Estimate for a Mean\

An interval estimate for a mean is an interval of values that is likely to contain the true population mean. The interval estimate for a mean is called a *confidence interval*. The interval estimate is constructed using a point estimate and a margin of error. The margin of error is calculated using the standard error of the point estimate. The common confidence level used in research are 90%, 95%, and 99%.\
